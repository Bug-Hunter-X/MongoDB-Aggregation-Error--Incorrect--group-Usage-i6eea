# MongoDB Aggregation Error: Incorrect $group Usage

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$group` operator in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. The issue arises from an incorrect understanding or application of the `$group` operator, leading to unexpected aggregation results or errors. The example highlights this problem and provides a solution.

## Problem
The provided code snippet shows an aggregation pipeline where the `$group` operator is used incorrectly.  This can manifest in various ways, including:

- Incorrect grouping: The `_id` field in the `$group` stage might not correctly define unique groups.
- Unexpected results: The aggregation might produce unexpected results due to incorrect grouping logic.
- Errors:  The pipeline could throw errors if the `$group` operation is improperly structured.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the `$group` operation to ensure that:

- The `_id` field is correctly defined to create the desired groups.
- Any other aggregation stages (e.g., `$match`, `$sort`, `$limit`) are correctly placed and integrated with the `$group` stage.
- Proper error handling is incorporated to gracefully manage potential issues like empty groups.

The solution code shows the correction needed to resolve the problem.
